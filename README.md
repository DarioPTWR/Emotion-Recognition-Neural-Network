# ðŸ˜Š Emotion-Recognition-Neural-Network
This project involves building a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model for multi-class image classification analysis, with the aim of identifying human emotions based on images of people provided in the dataset. To load and build the model, Tensorflow and Keras were mainly used for evaluation.
